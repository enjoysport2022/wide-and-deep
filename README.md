# Wide-and-Deep-Keras
Keras implementation of Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm

This is just a quick, fun excercise trying to implement Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm [wide and deep](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep) in Keras using the [Functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/). Needless to say, if you are ever going to go use Wide and Deep, go for the Tensorflow implementation. Original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792).
